            <h2>What are the risks involved with a volcano?</h2>
            <p>As with all volcanos, Volcan de Fuego throws out extremely hot magma in the event of an eruption. The location is also right next to a highly-populated city and tourist destination, Antigua, making it all the more casualty-ridden if and when an eruption is to happen.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padded-section">
            <h2>What options are there for notifications and community response when an eruption happens?</h2>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.icrc.org/en/where-we-work/americas/guatemala">Guatemala Red Cross</a> has locations across Guatemala that can provide assistance when a volcanic eruption happens.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padded-section">
            <h2>When was the last time Volcan de Fuego interrupted?</h2>
            <p>Vocan de Fuego had its last eruption in 2018.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padded-section">
            <h2>How would a volcanic eruption affect the environments in Guatemala?</h2>
            <p>Eruptions have historically damaged crops such as maize, coffee, sugarcane, as well as livestock.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padded-section">
            <h2>How do I know if a volcano is about to erupt?</h2>
            <p>An increase in the frequency and intensity of felt earthquakes, as well as in fumic-related activity are both signs that a volcanic eruption is about to occur.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="padded-section">
            <h2>Where should I evacuate to if a volcano is about to erupt?</h2>
            <p>Citizens of Guatemala should evacuate to any location they prefer. The government provides assistance for evacuation procedures for up to 15 days to any citizen of Guatemala after an eruption.</p>

        <h2>Remember!</h2>
        <p>Volcanoes can be a catastrophic event if you aren't prepared for when an eruption occurs. Make sure you're always ready when you live by a volcano, and you'll help to keep yourself and your loved ones safe and secure.</p>
