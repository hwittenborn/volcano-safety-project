# volcano-safety-project
This is the repository for the volcano safety project in my high school's environmental science class. Our class was put into groups where we had the options of doing multiple types of media presentations to show our understanding of volcano safety. Some of these options included doing a poster, video, and the option chosen here, a website.

Luckily for me, pretty much everyone in my class knows just about nothing about programming, so I was able to make our group stand out with a fancy website that acted extremely dumb. This website is the result of that.

## What I learned
I also used the process of making this website to learn some new things, such as:

- Installing packages from NPM
- How to use TypeScript
- How to bundle NPM modules for use in a browser
